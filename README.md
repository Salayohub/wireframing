# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a **visual blueprint** of a digital product’s layout, structure, and functionality. It serves as a low-fidelity representation of a user interface (UI), focusing on **content placement, navigation, and user interaction** without the distraction of colors, images, or detailed design elements.  

Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders **visualize the product early in the design process**, ensuring alignment before moving on to high-fidelity prototypes or development.  

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- **Clarifies Structure** – Defines how information and features will be organized within the interface.  
- **Encourages Collaboration** – Provides a common visual reference for stakeholders, designers, and developers.  
- **Saves Time and Cost** – Identifies usability issues early, reducing expensive redesigns during later stages.  
- **Focuses on User Experience (UX)** – Ensures that user journeys and navigation flows are intuitive before adding visual design.  

Wireframing is an essential step in transforming abstract ideas into clear, testable, and user-friendly designs.
